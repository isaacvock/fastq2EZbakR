####### GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CONFIG #######
#
# This config file allows you to specify a number of important pieces of information that
# the fastq2EZbakR pipeline will require to run. It also allows you to set optional parameters
# for all tools that fastq2EZbakR makes use of.
#
# File paths can either be absolute (e.g., ~/path/to/file/or/directory) or relative
# to the directory in which you are calling the pipeline from (e.g., data/fastq/WT_1 in the 
# example samples entry means to look in the data directory present in the directory
# where you called `snakemake` to run the pipeline).
#
####### PARAMETERS YOU NEED TO SET #######


# Download fastq files from SRA? If True, you don't need to specify paths to fastq files under samples.
# In fact, samples will go completely unused in this case
# NOTE: check if the fastq files you are downloading are all
# paired end or single end, and make sure to set PE accordingly
# below.
download_fastqs: False

# List of SRA accession codes to download fastq files from
# Only relevant if download_fastqs is True
sra_accessions: ["SRR24994162", "SRR24994161"]


# Providing bam files? If yes, set to True. Will skip all fastq-related steps (trimming, alignment, etc.)
bam2bakr: False

## Paths to data to process
# path to directory containing fastq files if bam2bakr is False
  # fastq files can be either gzipped or unzipped
  # Each set of fastq files must be in a different directory
# path to individual bam files if bam2bakr is True
samples:
    WT_1: data/fastq/WT_1
    WT_2: data/fastq/WT_2
    WT_ctl: data/fastq/WT_ctl
    KO_1: data/fastq/KO_1
    KO_2: data/fastq/KO_2
    KO_ctl: data/fastq/KO_ctl

## example of what samples will look like for bam file input
# samples:
#   WT_1: data/bams/WT_1.bam
#   WT_2: data/bams/WT_2.bam
#   WT_ctl: data/bams/WT_ctl.bam
#   KO_1: data/bams/KO_1.bam
#   KO_2: data/bams/KO_2.bam
#   KO_ctl: data/bams/KO_ctl.bam


# -s4U control sample IDs
control_samples: ['WT_ctl', 'KO_ctl']

# Paired end? 
  # Set to True or False, no double quotes
PE: True

# Path to genome fasta file
genome: data/genome/genome.fasta


# Path to annotation gtf file
annotation: data/annotation/genome.gtf


# Which aligner to use? 
  # Options are:
    # 1) star
    # 2) hisat2
aligner: "star"


# Path to directory containing indices
  # Indices will be built automatically if not present
  # I would suggest naming this "aligner"_index, though any
  # directory path name will do (avoid results/...; the 
  # results/ directory is where the pipeline output will be created,
  # so probably better to avoid specifying a path there that might
  # clash with the names of one of the other automatically created
  # directories). 
  # If you aren't providing this, directory must not exist at the time
  # you launch the pipeline with `snakemake ...`, or else Snakemake won't
  # know to create it.
indices: data/indices/star_index


# Strandedness
  # set to "reverse", "yes", or "no"
  # Instead of "yes", can now use "forward" as well (both will have the same result)
  # reverse means that read 2 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA (read 1 thus represents its reverse complement)
  # yes means that read 1 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA
  # no means unstranded
  # Used by featureCounts, though terminology comes from HTSeq
strandedness: "reverse"


# Features to assign reads to
  # genes = anywhere in an annotated gene body
  # exons = in exclusively exonic regions of a gene
  # tec = set of transcripts with which read overlaps; TEC = transcript equivalence class
  # exonic_bins = exonic regions as defined in DEXSeq paper (Anders et al., 2012)
  # junctions = exon-exon junctions. Only compatible with STAR-based alignment
    # as STAR's unique jI and jM bam file tags are required
  # threeputr = 3'-UTRs. Should only be used with 3'-end sequencing data.
    # This option is paired with `call_threeputrs` which determines whether or not
    # 3' UTRs are called de novo using your data or whether an annotation of 3'UTRs that
    # you provide is used
  # sc = single-cells. Should only be used with single-cell NR-seq data.
    # The output cB/arrow dataset will have an additional field called "cell"
    # denoting the cell barcode from which a group of reads came from. EZbakR
    # provides tools by which to create new and old read count matrices that can be
    # passed to other tools.
  # eej = exon-exon junctions. Less accurate than junctions but compatible with any
    # bam file. A new GTF file will be created with annotation for the junction_IDs
    # that will show up in the final cB
  # eij = exon-intron junctions. A new GTF file will be created with annotation for the junction_IDs
    # that will show up in the final cB
features:
    genes: True
    exons: True
    tec: False
    exonic_bins: False
    junctions: False

  # cB = standard cB file tracking number of mutations and number of mutable reference nucleotides in each read.
  # cUP = remove the mutable reference nucleotide count and instead compute the average of this value for reads
  #         with the same mutational content. This is orders of magnitude more compressed than a cB file (typically
  #         around 100x smaller), and is still compatible with EZbakR. Downside is the slight information loss that
  #         this compression leads to.

max_merge_mem: "8G"


### Track normalization parameters

# Normalize sequencing tracks?
normalize: True

# String common to spike-in gene_ids in annotation gtf
  # If you have no spike-ins, then this should be "\"\"", i.e., an empty string ("")
  # Used for normalization of tracks. Thus, only relevant if normalize == True

####### OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR THE VARIOUS TOOLS AND SCRIPTS USED #######

##### FEATURECOUNTS PARAMETERS #####
# Parameters automatically specified:
  # Genes: -R -f -g gene_id -t transcript
  # Exons: -R -g gene_id -J
  # Transcripts: -R -f -g transcript_id -t exon -O
  # Exonbins: -R -f -g exon_id -t exonic_part -O
# If PE = True, then "-p --countReadPairs" is also automatically set
#
# !!DO NOT REDUNDANTLY SPECIFY AUTOMATICALLY SPECIFIED PARAMETERS!!
# Defaults suggested:
# 1) Set -M for all cases. Non-primary multi-mapping reads are filtered
# prior to running featureCounts, so we want to count all reads. There
# seems to be a bug in featureCounts that can cause some primary, multi-mapping
# reads getting unassigned. Setting -M avoids this problem.
# 2) Set --nonOverlap to 0 for exon assignment. This is the key to exonic assignment,
# ensuring that reads overlapping any non-exonic region are unassigned to tne xonic feature (XF).
# Unfortunately, soft-clipping counts as non-assignment, so it is best to either turn off soft-clipping
# in your aligner (which is done in the defaults for STAR and HISAT2 below) or increase the 
# nonOverlap parameter to allow some leniency

##############################
# These currently do nothing, but might come back in future releases

# Add a full-gene "transcript" to annotation used for STAR + RSEM to quantify pre-mRNA.
  # This is a nice way to "regress out" pre-mRNA abundance and to identify
  # problematic gene annotations (e.g., regions where estimated pre-mRNA abundance
  # is as high if not higher than appreciably expressed isoforms).
  #
  # The annotation with the full-gene "transcript" will only be used for STAR's alignment
  # and RSEM quantification. The full-gene transcript will not be a feature to which
  # reads are assigned by featureCounts.
  # 
  # This will only have an impact if config["aligner"] is set to "star".
quantify_premRNA: False
  # Defunct as this currently has no impact on RSEM quantification


# Are there jI, jM, XF, GF, or EF tags in provided bam files?
  # These will break HTSeq or lead to unexpected behavior and will
  # thus be removed prior to running HTSeq.
  # NOTE: these tags will not be removed from the input bam files,
  # just from processed bam files generated by fastq2EZbakR
remove_tags: False
  # Defunct as HTSeq is no longer used and these tags cause no problems
  # to pipeline.

##### SALMON PARAMETERS #####
# NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

# Use Salmon for quantification?
use_salmon: False

# Path to directory containing Salmon indices
  # Created automatically if not already present
salmon_indices: "indices/salmon/"

# Determing if and how to make decoy-aware index for salmon

  # There are two options for how to make this index (see Salmon docs for details: https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html)
    # If entire_genome is True, then entire genome will be used. This provides a more comprehensive set of decoys at the cost of
    # requiring more RAM and time to build the index.
    # 
    # If entire_genome if False, then "a set of decoy sequences will be identified
    # by mapping annotated transcripts you wish to index against a hard-masked version
    # of the organism's genome." (quoted from documentation linked above). This leads to 
    # comparable performance as a whole genome decoy but is much less RAM intensive.

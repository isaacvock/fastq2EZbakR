### Why are there a low number of T-to-C mutations in the cB?

If there are very few T-to-C mutations in the final cB.csv file (e.g., if sample-wide mutation rates in +s<sup>4</sup>U samples are < 0.003), then you may have used the incorrect value for the `strandedness` parameter in the config. One way to tell if this is the case is by looking at one of the +s<sup>4</sup>U sample counts.csv files in `results/counts/` and checking for an abundance of A-to-G mutations. If this is the case, flip the value of `strandedness` to the opposite of whatever you used.

Related to the first point, a good sanity check after running the pipeline is going into R and checking the raw mutation rates as such:

```r
library(data.table)

# To unzip and read cB, also need to have R.utils package installed
cB <- fread("path/to/cB.csv.gz")

# Assess sample-wide T-to-C mutation rate in each sample
cB[,.(mutrate = sum(TC*n)/sum(nT*n), by = sample]
  # Want to see that +s4U samples has higher mutation rate than -s4U samples
```

Similarly, checking a counts.csv file for an abundance of A-to-G mutations can be done as follows:

```r
library(data.table)

counts <- fread("path/to/+s4U/counts.csv.gz")

## Check if A-to-G mutation rate is higher than T-to-C mutation rate:

# A-to-G mutation rate
sum(counts$AG)/sum(counts$nA)

# T-to-C mutation rate
sum(counts$TC)/sum(counts$nT)
```

### Lots of "__no_feature" in cB feature columns

If a large number of reads in the cB.csv.gz file have a feature (i.e., the annotated feature the read was assigned to) value of "__no_feature", this likely has a similar cause to the low T-to-C mutation problem discussed above. That is, the strandedness of the library may be improperly defined in the config. Thus, check that the `strandedness` parameter in the config file is properly set, and confirm the strandedness of your library.
